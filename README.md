# MachineLearning
Machine Learning library by Dario Bernardo

This repository contains a set of algorithms and tests units that I wrote in Java.
The linear algebra operations are optimised using JBLAS library, a fast library for GPU based computations.
The algorithms implemented at the moment are:

- Logistic regression (with gradient descent)
- Neural network (with gradient descent)
- Montecarlo simulation (of a random walk) and an exaple of aplying it to a card game named Perlino (wich I used to beat some friends)
