# MachineLearning
Machine Learning library by Dario Bernardo

This repository contains a set of algorithms and units tests that I wrote in Java.
The linear algebra operations are optimised using the JBLAS library.
The algorithms implemented at the moment are:

- Logistic regression (with gradient descent)
- Neural network (with gradient descent)
- Montecarlo simulation (of a random walk) and an example of applying it to a card game named Perlino (which I used to win against some friends)
