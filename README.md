# MachineLearning
Machine Learning library by Dario Bernardo

This repository contains a set of algorithms and tests units that I wrote in Java.

- Logistic regression (with gradient descent)
- Neural network (with gradient descent)
- Montecarlo simulation (of a random walk) and an exaple of aplying it to a card game named Perlino (wich I used to beat some friends)
